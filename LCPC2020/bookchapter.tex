\begin{abstract}
Relaxed memory accesses are used to gain substantial improvement in the performance of concurrent programs.
A relaxed consistency model specifically describes the semantics of such memory accesses for a particular programming language. 
Historically, such semantics are often ill defined or misunderstood, and have been shown to 
conflict with common compiler optimizations essential for the performance of programs overall.
In this paper, we give a formal description of the ECMAScript relaxed memory consistency model. 
We then analyze the impact of this model on one of the most common compiler optimizations, viz. \textit{instruction reordering}. We give a conservative proof under which such optimization is allowed for relaxed memory accesses. 
Finally, we discuss the advantage of our conservative approach and the gaps needed to be filled in order to incorporate such analysis while doing such optimizations at the program level.

\section{The ECMAScript Memory Consistency Model}
    
    We give a relatively more formal and concise axiomatic description of Section 28 of the ECMAScript standard. The version we are referring to is the current working draft~\cite{ECMA}. It is important to note that this working draft has not changed the memory model specifics since the time we started our work on this.
