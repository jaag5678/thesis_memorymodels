\section{Conclusion and Future work}
Our more declarative approach to the ECMAScript memory consistency model results in a relatively compact and concise description of the semantics.
This better facilitates mathematical reasoning, which we have used to investigate the conditions on basic optimization operations such as instruction reordering.

Future work is aimed at extending our analysis to validate the conditions for redundancy elimination.

We are also interested in further exploring the constraints implied by the potential for multi-byte (non-atomic) accesses.  The current standard imposes only very weak conditions on overlapping accesses, but stronger conditions are likely necessary to reflect actual programming practice.
