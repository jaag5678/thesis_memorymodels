    \subsection{Agents and Agent Clusters}
        Agents for our context could be thought analogous to different threads/processes running concurrently. 
        Every agent is mapped to a list of events. (defined below) 
        Collection of agents using a common shared memory for communication form an agent cluster. 
        There can be multiple agent clusters, however, an agent can only belong to one agent cluster.
