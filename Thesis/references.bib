Unlike most previous approaches, which enumerate thread interleavings up to some partial order reduction improvements, our approach works directly on execution graphs and (in the absence of RMW instructions and SC atomics) avoids redundant exploration by construction. We have implemented a model checker, called RCMC, based on this approach and applied it to a number of challenging concurrent programs. Our experiments confirm that RCMC is significantly faster, scales better than other model checking tools, and is also more resilient to small changes in the benchmarks.},

  abstract = {We present GenMC, a model checking algorithm for concurrent programs that is parametric in the choice of memory model and can be used for verifying clients of concurrent libraries. Subject to a few basic conditions about the memory model, our algorithm is sound, complete and optimal, in that it explores each consistent execution of the program according to the model exactly once, and does not explore inconsistent executions or embark on futile exploration paths. We implement GenMC as a tool for verifying C programs. Despite the generality of the algorithm, its performance is comparable to the state-of-art specialized model checkers for specific memory models, and in certain cases exponentially faster thanks to its coarse partitioning of executions.},
