    Although we have identified the cases when \textit{happens-before} relations are preserved, we also get some additional relations in some of them.

    %Show an example here and explain
    As an example, for the case when $d$ is a sequentially consistent read, by lemma 1, in any execution of $C$
    \[
        \reln{k}{hb}{d} \centernot\Rightarrow \reln{k}{hb}{e} 
    \]

    But in $Executions$ of candidate $C'$, by transitivity, we have 
    \[
        \reln{k}{hb}{d} \Rightarrow \reln{k}{hb}{e} 
    \]

    This is because, there are sets of relations that come through certain \textit{synchronize-with} relations. Thus, although we are able to preserve relations that existed in any $Candidate Execution$ of $C$, we also in the process, introduce new ones in $Candidate Executions$ of $C'$. The figure below shows pictorially an example of a Candidate Execution of $C$ for the case above

    \critic{purple}{Explain the above figures or perhaps highlight the new relations that are established.}


    To summarize, the table below shows the cases where new relations could be introduced. 
    %Show the table here

        \label{fig:my_label}
    \end{figure}

    For these cases, we must know whether these new relations introduce new observable behaviors.
