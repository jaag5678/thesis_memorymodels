\begin{theorem} 

    Consider a candidate $C$ of a program and its possible \textit{Candidate Executions} where $\stck{_\textit{hb}}$ is strictly partial order. Consider two events $e$ and $d$ such that $\cons{e}{d}$ is true in $C$ and  $\reln{e}{ao}{d}$. Consider another candidate $C'$ resulting after reordering $e$ and $d$. 
    Then if \emph{Reord(e,d)} is true in $C$, the set observable behaviors possible due to Candidate Executions of $C'$ is a subset of that of $C$. 
\end{theorem}
