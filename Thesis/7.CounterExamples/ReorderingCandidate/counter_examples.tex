

    For all the examples we show here, we only show the ordering relations that are important to observe. 
    We exhaustively show for all the cases from Table \ref{reord:final_table} where reordering is not safe to do. 
    Some of these cases are addressed together as the same counter example suffices to show they are unsafe to do.

    \paragraph{Reads to same memory where $e$ is of type $sc$ and $d$ is either $uo/sc$}

        The following example illustrates when reordering two reads to $x$ as per the specification of their access orders and range results in an observable behavior disallowed.
        Figure~\ref{reord_counter:example1(a)} shows an example of a candidate (left) along with with its candidate execution (right) where the case of outcome in the red box is not possible. 
        \begin{figure}[H]

        \end{figure}
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For $a=2$, it must come from the write $y=2;_{sc}$. 
            Thus, we would have $\reln{\{y=2;_{sc}\}}{sw}{\{a=y;_{sc}\}}$ and hence $\reln{\{y=2;_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{a=y;_{sc}\}}$.
            \item For $b=2$, it must come from the write $x=2$. 
            Thus, we would have $\reln{\{x=2;_{sc}\}}{sw}{\{b=x;_{sc}\}}$ and hence $\reln{\{x=2;_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{b=x;_{sc}\}}$.
            \item Using $\stck{_{ao}}$ and the above result, we can infer that $\reln{\{x=2;_{sc}\}}{mo}{\{x=2;_{sc}\}}$, $\reln{\{x=1;_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{c=x;_{uo/sc}\}}$ and $\reln{\{x=2;_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{c=x;_{uo/sc}\}}$.
            \item These relations correspond to patterns of Axiom \ref{SeqCsAt}, from which we can conclude that we cannot have $\reln{\{c=x;_{uo/sc}\}}{rf}{\{x=1;_{sc}\}}$.         
        \end{itemize}
        Hence, the observable behavior $a=2 \ \wedge \ b=2 \ \wedge \ c=1$ is disallowed.

        Figure~\ref{reord_counter:example1(b)} shows the Candidate (right) after reordering the two reads in $T2$ along with its candidate execution (left) where the same case of reads(orange box) is possible. 
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{7.CounterExamples/ReorderingCandidate/Example0R(Rsc-Ruo,sc).pdf}
            \caption{Case where the reads are reordered and $a = 2 , b = 2, c = 1$ is valid.}
            \label{reord_counter:example1(b)}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item For $a=2$, it must come from the write $y=2_{sc}$. 
            Thus, we would have $\reln{\{y=2;_{sc}\}}{sw}{\{a=y;_{sc}\}}$ and hence $\reln{\{y=2;_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{a=y;_{sc}\}}$.
            \item From this, we also get $\reln{\{x=1;_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{c=x;_{uo/sc}\}}$ and $\reln{\{x=1;_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{b=x;_{sc}\}}$.
            \item Now, for $c=1$, it must come from the write $\{x=1;_{sc}\}$. 
            This is possible as the above relations do not represent any pattern that restricts $\reln{\{c=x;_{uo/sc}\}}{rf}{\{x=1;_{sc}\}}$. .  
            \item Now for $b=2$, it must come from the write $\{x=2;_{sc}\}$.
            Since there is no happens-before or memory-order relations with this write, none of the axioms would restrict $\reln{\{b=x;_{sc}\}}{rf}{\{x=2;_{sc}\}}$.        
        \end{itemize}
        Thus, the observable behavior $a=1 \ \wedge \ b=2 \ \wedge \ c=2$ is allowed by the program after reordering.

    \paragraph{A Read $e$ of type $sc$ followed by a Write of either $uo/sc$}
        
        Figure~\ref{reord_counter:example2(a)} shows an example of a candidate (left) along with with its candidate execution (right) where the case of outcome in the red box is not possible. 
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{7.CounterExamples/ReorderingCandidate/Example3(Rsc-Wuo,sc).pdf}
            \caption{Case where $a = 1, b = 1$ is invalid due to Coherent Reads.}
            \label{reord_counter:example2(a)}
        \end{figure}

        Observations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For $a=1$, it must come from the write $x=1_{sc}$. 
            Thus, we would have $\reln{\{x=1;_{sc}\}}{sw}{\{a=x;_{sc}\}}$ and hence $\reln{\{x=1;_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{a=x;_{sc}\}}$.
            \item From the above relation and using $\stck{_{ao}}$, we can infer $\reln{\{b=y_{uo/sc}\}}{hb}{\{y=1_{uo/sc}\}}$
            \item The above relation corresponds to a pattern of Axiom \ref{CoRe}, from which we can infer that we cannot have the relation  $\reln{\{b=y;_{uo/sc}\}}{rf}{\{y=1;_{uo/sc}\}}$.        
        \end{itemize}
        Hence, the observable behavior $a=1 \ \wedge \ b=1$ is disallowed.

        Figure~\ref{reord_counter:example2(b)} shows the Candidate after reordering(right) a read and write in $T1$ along with its candidate execution(left) where the same case of reads(orange box) is possible. 
        \begin{figure}[H]

            \label{reord_counter:example2(b)}
        \end{figure}
        
        Observations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For $a=1$, it must come from the write $x=1_{sc}$. 
            Thus, we would have $\reln{\{x=1;_{sc}\}}{sw}{\{a=x;_{sc}\}}$ and hence $\reln{\{x=1;_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{a=x;_{sc}\}}$.
            \item From the above, we cannot infer $\reln{\{b=y_{uo/sc}\}}{hb}{\{y=1_{uo/sc}\}}$. In fact no happens-before relation can exist between the two events.
            \item We can have the relation $\reln{\{b=y;_{uo/sc}\}}{rf}{\{y=1;_{uo/sc}\}}$.
        \end{itemize}
        Hence, the observable behavior $a=1 \ \wedge \ b=1$ is allowed.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        
    \paragraph{A Read $e$ of type $uo$ followed by a write $d$ of type $sc$}

        For this we can use the same example in Figure~\ref{reord_counter:example2(a)} where we just reorder $T2$'s events.
        We leave justifying the new observable behavior introduced as an exercise for the reader.
    
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
    \paragraph{A Write $e$ followed by a Read $d$ both of type $sc$}
        
        A counter example for this is different. 
        It is not the Observable Behavior we are concerned with that is introduced, but that which is allowed after reordering creates a $\stck{_{hb}}$ cycle. 
        Figure~\ref{reord_counter:example3(a)} is one such example with its Candidate and Corresponding Candidate Execution in question:
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{7.CounterExamples/ReorderingCandidate/Example5(Wsc-Rsc).pdf}
            \caption{Case where $a = 1, b = 1$ is valid and no happens-before cycles}
            \label{reord_counter:example3(a)}
        \end{figure}

        Figure~\ref{reord_counter:example3(b)} shows the Candidate after reordering(right) the two events in $T1$, which makes the same candidate execution(right) as above contain a happens-before cycle:
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{7.CounterExamples/ReorderingCandidate/Example5R(Wsc-Rsc).pdf}
            \caption{Case where $a = 1, b = 1$ implies a happens-before cycle}
            \label{reord_counter:example3(b)}
        \end{figure}

        Observation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item From the read values we can infer that the Candidate Execution should have $\reln{\{x=1_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{a=x_{sc}\}}$ and $\reln{\{y=1_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{a=y_{sc}\}}$.
            \item The above relations create the cycle $\reln{\{a=y_{sc}\}}{hb}{\reln{\{x=1_{sc}\}}{hb}{\reln{\{a=x_{sc}\}}{hb}{\reln{\{y=1_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{a=y_{sc}\}}}}}$.
            \item This execution is invalid. 
        \end{itemize}

        One might think that simply discarding the above Candidate execution would do. 
        But this would mean discarding certain $\stck{_{hb}}$ relations by considering them to be irrelevant; this would require more information to infer which relations are going to create such cycles and which are not. 
        In practice a cycle may span several events from different threads.
        Since we place no assumptions on these relations.
        Hence, the following reordered program outcome is something we do not risk to allow.

    \paragraph{A Write $e$ of type $uo/sc$ followed by a Write $d$ of type $sc$}
        
        Figure~\ref{reord_counter:example4(a)} shows an example of a candidate(left) along with with its candidate execution(right) where the case of outcome in the red box is not possible. 
        \begin{figure}[H]

            \label{reord_counter:example4(a)}
        \end{figure}
        
        Observations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For $b=1$, it must come from the write $y=1_{sc}$. 
            Thus, we would have $\reln{\{y=1;_{sc}\}}{sw}{\{b=y;_{sc}\}}$ and hence $\reln{\{y=1;_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{b=y;_{sc}\}}$.
            \item From the above relation, we can infer $\reln{\{x=0_{init}\}}{hb}{\reln{\{x=1_{uo/sc}\}}{hb}{\{a=x_{uo/sc}\}}}$.
            \item The above relation corresponds to a pattern of Axiom \ref{CoRe}, from which we can conclude that we cannot have $\reln{\{a=x;_{uo/sc}\}}{rf}{\{x=0;_{init}\}}$.
        \end{itemize}
        Hence, the observable behavior $a=0 \ \wedge \ b=1$ is disallowed.

        Figure~\ref{reord_counter:example4(b)} shows the Candidate after reordering(right) the two writes in $T1$ along with its candidate execution(left) where the same case of reads(orange box) is possible.

        Observations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For $b=1$, it must come from the write $y=1_{sc}$. 
            Thus, we would have $\reln{\{y=1;_{sc}\}}{sw}{\{b=y;_{sc}\}}$ and hence $\reln{\{y=1;_{sc}\}}{hb}{\{b=y;_{sc}\}}$.
            \item From the above relation and $\stck{_{ao}}$, we cannot infer $\reln{\{x=1_{uo/sc}\}}{hb}{\{a=x_{uo/sc}\}}$.
            \item Thus, we can have  $\reln{\{a=x;_{uo/sc}\}}{rf}{\{x=0;_{init}\}}$.
        \end{itemize}
        Hence, the observable behavior $a=0 \ \wedge \ b=1$ is allowed.
