\begin{theorem} 
    \label{ThmReord}
    Consider a candidate $C$ of a program and its possible \textit{Candidate Executions} where $\stck{_\textit{hb}}$ is strictly partial order. Consider two events $e$ and $d$ such that 
    \begin{align*}
        \cons(e,d) \ \wedge \ \reln{e}{ao}{d}. 
    \end{align*}
    Consider another candidate $C'$ resulting after reordering $e$ and $d$. 
    Then if \emph{Reord(e,d)} is $true$ in $C$, the set Observable Behaviors possible due to Candidate Executions of $C'$ is a subset of that of $C$. 
\end{theorem}
