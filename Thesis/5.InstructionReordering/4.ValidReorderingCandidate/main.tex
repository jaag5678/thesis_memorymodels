Our main objective is to ensure that the set of possible observable behaviors of a program, remain unchanged after reordering. If that is not feasible, then we would want the set of observable behaviors after reordering at the very least to be a subset. This is to ensure that the Candidate of a program does not have some new behaviours that weren't supposed to happen prior to reordering.
