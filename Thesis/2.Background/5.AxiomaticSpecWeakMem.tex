%Start by mentioning the two forms of specificaitons that have come up in literature for weak memory models.
%Go about by specifying the advantages of axiomatic specificaiton.
%Give a jist about it and why it helps us in reasoning with program transformations. 

%Place here works done by Pradeep Sandhu, hinting towards an axiomatic specification.

%Then mention that the models prescribed by Batty, Viktor, Mansen, Sevcik are also all Axiomatic. 

%THen mention a good tutorial starting point about axiomatic specificaiton of memory models and how it helps understanding relaxed memory behavior.
