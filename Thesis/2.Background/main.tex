This chapter starts with a review of key previous work done in the domain of relaxed memory models.
We start by eliciting research works done in the design of memory models, coupled with works exposing problems due to ill defined or informally specified semantics. 
We then elicit research works done in the context of different memory models concerning validity of program transformations. 
Finally, we end with a list of tutorial works done in the axiomatic style specification of memory models.

As a summary, this chapter elicited the key research works done in the domain of relaxed memory models, its specification and its impact of program transformations. 
In the next chapter, we state the problems in the existing specification of the ECMAScript memory model, followed by a more formal specification of the same.
