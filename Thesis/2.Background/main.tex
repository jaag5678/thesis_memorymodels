This chapter starts with a review of key previous work done in the domain of relaxed memory models.
We start by eliciting research works done in the design of memory models, coupled with works exposing problems due to ill defined or informally specified semantics. 
We then elicit research works done in the context of different memory models with respect to validity of program transformations. 
Finally, we end with a list of tutorial works done in the axiomatic style specification of memory models.

   Our analysis is based on this corrected model by Watt et al.~\cite{WattC} which is incorporated in the ECMAScript draft specification. As far as our knowledge goes, no analysis has been done on this model to identify its implications on standard compiler optimizations.

As a summary, this chapter elicited the key researhc works done in the domain of relaxed memory models, its specificaiton and its impact of program transformations. 
In the next chapter, we state the problems in the existing specification of the ECMAScript memory model, followed by a more formal specificaiton of the same.
