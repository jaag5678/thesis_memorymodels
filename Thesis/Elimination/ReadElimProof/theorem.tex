\begin{theorem}
    Consider a candidate $C$ of a program and its possible \textit{Candidate Executions} where $\stck{_\textit{hb}}$ is strictly partial order. Consider an event $e$ which is a read. Consider another Candidate $C'$ without the event $e$. If $e$ has an unordered access mode, then the set of Observable behaviors of $C'$ is a subset of $C$ without the relation $\reln{e}{rf}{w}$ where $w$ is some write event in $C$.
