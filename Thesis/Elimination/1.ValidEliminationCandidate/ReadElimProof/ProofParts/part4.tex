\paragraph{4. Do the lost relations result in New Observable Behaviors?}

        To answer this, we need to see whether the relations removed had an impact on $\stck{_{rf}}$ relations other than those with $e$. To prove that it does not have any impact, we divide our argument into two parts, viz. into the two types of relations removed:

        \begin{tasks}(2)
            \task $\reln{k}{hb}{R_uo}$ 
            \task $\reln{R_uo}{hb}{k}$ 
        \end{tasks}

        In the first case, we have the following possibilities. 
        \begin{figure}[H]

            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Elimination/1.ValidEliminationCandidate/ReadElimProof/ProofParts/Part4_Case1.pdf}
            \caption{The first type of relations removed and the various patterns forbidden by them.}
        \end{figure}

        Observations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (i) is not a pattern forbidden by the consistency rules.
            \item (ii)(a) is a pattern of Axiom \ref{CoRe}, however, only restricting $\stck{_{rf}}$ relation with $R$ and $W'$(which here is our Unordered Read)
            \item (ii)(b) is a pattern of Axiom \ref{SeqCsAt}, however, once again, only restricting $\stck{_{rf}}$ relation with $R$ and $W'$. 
        \end{itemize}

        In the second case, we have the following possibilites.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Elimination/1.ValidEliminationCandidate/ReadElimProof/ProofParts/Part4_Case2.pdf}
            \caption{The second type of relations removed and the various patterns forbidden by them.}
        \end{figure}

        Observations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (i) is not a pattern in any Consistency rules
            \item (ii) is a pattern of Axiom \ref{CoRe}, however, only restricting $\stck{_{rf}}$ relation with $R$ and $W$
        \end{itemize}

        From the above observations, we can infer that the relations removed only have restriction on reads-from relations on the event $e$ we eliminate. Thus, we can conclude that no new observable behaviors are introduced due to the removed $\stck{_{hb}}$ relations.
