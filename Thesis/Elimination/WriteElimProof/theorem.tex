\begin{theorem}
    Consider a candidate $C$ of a program and its possible \textit{Candidate Executions} where $\stck{_\textit{hb}}$ is strictly partial order. Consider two \textbf{write} events $e$ and $d$ such that $\cons{e}{d}$ is true in $C$ and  $\reln{e}{ao}{d}$. Consider a Candidate $C'$ without event $e$.  If $e$ has an unordered access mode and $e$ and $d$ have the same range, then the set of Observable behaviors of $C'$ is a subset of $C$.
