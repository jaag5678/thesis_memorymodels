\section{From Candidates to Program}

    At the program level, similar to that of reordering, we first address programs with just conditional branches.
    We establish a conservative condition under which elimination of write in the presence of conditionals is safe, followed by justifying for that of reads.

    We then move on to addressing programs with loops.
    Within this section, we first address elimination of a read in the presence of loops.
    We then state a corollary that establishes the condition under which write elimination is safe in the presence of loops.
    In both the above cases, we assume the eliminated event belongs within the loop.

    Lastly, we establish the conditions under which loop invariant code motion is sound (4 corollaries with proof) using both our results from that of reordering and elimination of events.
