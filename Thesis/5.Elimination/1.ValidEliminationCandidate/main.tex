\section{Valid Elimination at the Candidate level}

    For addressing the validity of eliminations under our memory model, we separately address first Read elimination, followed by Write elimination, both at the candidate level. 
    At the Candidate level, eliminating an event would imply removal of certain ordering relations at the Candidate Execution level. 
    Given an event $e$ belonging to a Candidate $C$, the candidate $C'$ after eliminating event $e$ from it would imply no relations of the form 
    \begin{align*}
        \reln{k}{ao}{e} \\  
        \reln{e}{ao}{k}.
    \end{align*}
    and no relations of the form
    \begin{align*}
        \reln{k}{hb}{e} \\
        \reln{e}{hb}{k}.
    \end{align*}
    exist in any Candidate Execution of $C'$.
    
    %Read Elimination 
    \subsection{Elimination of Reads}

        The following theorem establishes the condition when we can eliminate a read from a Candidate, while still ensuring that the result Candidate has observable behaviors as a subset.

    %Write elimination
    \subsection{Elimination of Writes}

        The following theorem establishes the condition when we can eliminate a write from a Candidate, given that we have another write consecutive to it.
