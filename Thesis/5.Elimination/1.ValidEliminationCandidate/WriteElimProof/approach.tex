    Theorem \ref{WriteElim} establishes the condition when we can eliminate a write given that there exists another write with equal range consecutive to it.
    We now establish the condition when we can eliminate such a write without having a constraint on another consecutive write to be present. 
    The following corollary along with its proof describes this exact scenario.
