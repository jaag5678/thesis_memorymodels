\begin{theorem}
    \label{WriteElim}
    Consider a candidate $C$ of a program and its possible \textit{Candidate Executions} where $\stck{_\textit{hb}}$ is strictly partial order. 
    Consider two \textbf{write} events $e$ and $d$ in $C$ such that 
    \begin{align*}
        \cons{e}{d} \ \wedge \ \reln{e}{ao}{d}. 
    \end{align*}
    Consider a Candidate $C'$ without event $e$.  
    If
    \begin{align*}
        \et{e}{uo} \ \wedge \ \Re(e) = \Re(d). 
    \end{align*}
    then the set of Observable behaviors of $C'$ is a subset of $C$.
