\begin{theorem}
    \label{ReadElim}
    Consider a candidate $C$ of a program and its possible \textit{Candidate Executions} where $\stck{_\textit{hb}}$ is a strict partial order. Consider an event $e$ in $C$ such that $e \in R$. 
    Consider Candidate $C'$ after eliminating the event $e$ from $C$. 
    If $e$ has access mode $uo$, then the set of Observable behaviors of $C'$ is a subset of $C$ without the relation $\reln{e}{rf}{w}$ where $w$ is some write event in both $C$ and $C'$.
