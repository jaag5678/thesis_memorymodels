\begin{proof}
    We look at this as an elimination of $e$ that takes place in any candidate execution of $C$. 
    We then go about answering the same four questions as we did for reordering. 
    The only major change here being that elimination implies removal $\stck{_{hb}}$ relations, in contrast to introducing new ones.
    We must check whether the removal of these relations introduce new behaviors, in contrast to that in reordering, where new relations were introduced.
