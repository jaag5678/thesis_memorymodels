    Our main objective is to ensure that the set of possible observable behaviors of a program, remain unchanged after reordering.
    If that is not feasible, then we would want the set of observable behaviors after reordering at the very least to be a subset.

    \subsection{Reordering of Consecutive Events}
        \input{4.InstructionReordering/4.ValidReorderingCandidate/theorem.tex}
        \input{4.InstructionReordering/4.ValidReorderingCandidate/proof.tex}

    \subsection{Reordering Non-Consecutive Events}
        \input{4.InstructionReordering/4.ValidReorderingCandidate/corollary.tex}

    For cases where reordering is not safe to do, we also show counter examples of programs where new observable behaviors are introduced.
    This additionally helps gain intuition about the proof given. 
    Note that we do not show examples for cases where $\reln{d}{hb}{e}$ itself is sufficient to show a new observable behavior, as this is a trivial exercise that can be done just using sequential programs.
    We show counterexamples where $\stck{_{hb}}$ relations lost (those across agents specifically), could introduce new observable behaviors. 
    These examples are in Appendix A.1.
