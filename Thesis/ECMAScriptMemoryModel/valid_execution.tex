   \section{Consistent Executions (Valid Observables)}
        A valid observable behaviour is when:
        \begin{enumerate}
           \item No $\stck{_\textit{rf}}$ relation violates the above memory consistency rules.
           \item $\stck{_\textit{hb}}$ is a strict partial order.
        \end{enumerate} 

        \textit{The memory model guarantees that every program must have at least one valid observable behaviour.}

        \critic{blue}{There is also some conditions on host-specific events (which we mentioned is not of our main concern) and what is called a chosen read, which is nothing but the reads that the underlying hardware memory model allows. Since we are not concerned with the memory models of different hardware, this restriction on reads is not of our concern.}
