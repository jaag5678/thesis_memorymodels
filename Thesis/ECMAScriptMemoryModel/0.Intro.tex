
The model we consider is the current draft specification (cite here) of ECMAScript standard. 
This draft as far as the memory model goes has remain unchanged, so we believe our work will also be of use to those working on thismodel. 
The specification is claimed to be axiomatic by definition, which should, in our view remove the complexities of the rest of thestandard from the semantics of the model.
However, as we noted, there were quite some concerns with it: 

\paragraph{The Model is Quite Algorithmic}
    Although the standard states that the model is not supposed to be operational, the specificaitons of the model state otherwise. 
    There are quite a few abstract operations which are not necessary to understand the semantics of the model. 
    As an example, consider one of the Axioms of the model below as stated by the standard. 
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering 
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ECMAScriptMemoryModel/ECMAScriptStdCoherentReads.pdf}
        \caption{The definition for Coherent Reads}
    \end{figure}
    The above axiom is specified as a return value to an abstract operation. While understanding this requires one to know thedefintions of $Ws$, $execution$, $SharedDataBlockEventSet$ abstract operation, etc. we believe this is not needed as to understandwhat the axiom is about, which informally can be stated as below in two points:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A read's value cannot come from a write that has happened after it. 
        \item A read's value cannot come from a write that has been overwritten by some other write.  
    \end{itemize}
    Axiomatically, we define the above two points using simple binary relations that we derive from the specification to exist amongevents. The entire specification is structured in a similar way. 

\paragraph{Certain Unnecessary Definitions}
    
    Certain abstract operations are not required to capture the semantics of the model. 
    One such example is in the figure below:
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering 
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ECMAScriptMemoryModel/ECMAScriptStd.pdf}
        \caption{The definition for Compose Write Event Bytes}
    \end{figure}
    The above figure is the definition of an abstract operation. To understand what this operation does, one must know the meaning ofthe terms $ModifyOp$, $Payload$, the list $Ws$, and also know what the argument $ByteIndex$ signifies. 
    In its essence, the above operation gives the read-values read by a single write by collecting the values from their correspondingwrites. 
    We realized that one need not know this operation nor understand its function as it does not play a role in the semantics of themodel. 
    Other such abstract operations are $ValueOfReadEvent$ and $ValidChosenReads$. 

\paragraph{Still a bit verbose}
    
    The entire model, is still quite verbose, which makes it difficult to understand the main objective of the model semantics. 
    The following figure is the std specification of another Axiom 
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering 
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ECMAScriptMemoryModel/ECMAScriptStdSeqCnsAt.pdf}
        \caption{The Axiom of Sequentially Consistent Atomics}
    \end{figure}
    The above figure, though written concisely, in our view still makes it difficult to understand. 
    We reduced the above entire axiom into three main patterns using binary relations that should not exist in any execution of aprogram. 
    While the latter part is less of a semantic specification and more of a programming guideline while using relaxed memory accesses.(one can make countless counter-examples for this.) 
Given the above concerns about the model specificaiton in the standard, we formalized it axiomatically in the form of binary relationsover events involved and axioms that place restrictions on certain binary relations using the others.
