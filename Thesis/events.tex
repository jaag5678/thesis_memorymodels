    \subsection{Events}
        
        An evaluation of an operation results in a set of events that are evaluated. An event is either an operation that involves (shared) memory access or that constrains the order of execution of multiple events. The latter are called \textit{Synchronize Events}

        \critic{blue}{Synchronizing events are analogous to $lock$ and $unlock$ events that allow exclusive access to critical sections of memory.}
