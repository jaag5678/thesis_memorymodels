\section{Valid Elimination at the Candidate level}


    Similar to reordering, our main objective is to ensure that the set of possible observable behaviors of a program, remain unchanged after elimination. 
    In the case of read elimination, we would want the observable behaviors apart from the specific read eliminated to be a subset.
    If that is not feasible, then we would want the set of observable behaviors after reordering at the very least to be a subset.
