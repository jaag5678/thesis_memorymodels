The previous chapter addressed the validity of elimination of relaxed memory accesses. 
We also showed how validity of loop invariant code motion can be done using reordering coupled with elimination of events. 
In this concluding chapter, we discuss the limitations of our approach from a practical standpoint.
We later chart out further steps that can be taken from our work that we find important to address. 
We elicit takeaway from this thesis work and conclude with possible future work in the domain of relaxed memory models.
