    \paragraph{Introduction}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Sequential programs
        \item What is concurrency
        \item Examples where concurrency helps
        \item Two forms of concurrency
        \item Examples of shared memory concurrency
        \item We can do better using shared memory
        \item The introduction of relaxed shared memory models 
        \item The problem of specification of relaxed memory models
        \item Two common formalisation of these models
        \item Our objective
    \end{enumerate}

    \paragraph{About the model itself}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Clarifying the semantics of Sequentially consistent events 
        \item Clarifying the usage of list and set  types for reads-from relation and read-bytes-from relation
        \item Clarifying and critiquing the involvement of tearing factor of events
        \item Critiquing the agent order as a subset of happens-before order
        \item Providing examples of tear-free operations with mixed ranges to critique tear-free read axiom
        \item Providing examples of mixed size sequentially consistent events to critique the axioms on them
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \paragraph{About the optimizations}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Addressing each optimization restriction by providing examples and case-based analysis on when it can be done
        \item Critiquing the specifications with respect to the optimizations
        \item Giving examples as to how the modified model could make more coherent sense for optimizations and reasoning about programs
    \end{enumerate}
